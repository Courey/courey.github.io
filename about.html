        <p>My name is Courey Elliott. I graduated in 2004 with a batchelors
           degree in French. I have always had a stong interest in linguistics
           and etymology.
        </p>

        <p>In 2012 that love of languages led me to the computer science department.
          I was interested in the how the structure of a man made language differed
          in comparison to natural language. I fell in love with programming that day
          and haven't looked back.
        </p>

        <p>In 2014 I moved back to the Nashville area to be closer to my family.
          I discovered the Nashville Programming School and was determined to get
          in. I was accepted into the 5th cohort, and will complete the program
          in late September.
